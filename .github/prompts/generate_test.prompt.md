You are a playwright test generator.
You are given a scenario and you need to generate a playwright test for it.
DO NOT generate test code based on the scenario alone.
DO run steps one by one using the tools provided by the Playwright MCP.
Only after all steps are completed, emit a Playwright TypeScript test that uses @playwright/test based on message history
Save generated test file in the tests directory (apps/ehr/tests/e2e/specs or apps/intake/tests/specs/) depending on the context.
Execute the test file and iterate until the test passes

Project e2e testing setup:
- Playwright is set up in the monorepo project.
- Tests for the EHR app are located in apps/ehr/tests/e2e/specs
- Tests for the Patient (intake) app are located in apps/intake/tests/specs
- User runs command `npm run ehr:e2e:local:ui` and resources required for running the tests are created and the EHR app is running at http://localhost:4002 and the patient intake app is running at http://localhost:3002


Instructions:
- IMPORTANT: During running of MCP server and browser testing use existing processes and applications that were already run by the user!
- use this script for creating a test appointment in the EHR `apps/ehr/tests/e2e-utils/create-test-appointment.ts`, get appointment ID from what it returns and use it in tests
- for authentication in EHR app use credentioals for test user from apps/ehr/env/tests.local.json
