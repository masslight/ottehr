# Radiology Integration in Progress Notes

## Overview
This implementation adds radiology study information to the Progress Note page as requested in issue #3274. The changes allow healthcare providers to view radiology orders, diagnoses, clinical history, and results directly within the Progress Note workflow.

## Implementation Details

### 1. RadiologyContainer Component
**Location:** `apps/ehr/src/features/css-module/components/progress-note/RadiologyContainer.tsx`

**Features:**
- Fetches radiology orders using `usePatientRadiologyOrders` hook
- Displays radiology information in a consistent format with other Progress Note sections
- Handles loading states and empty states gracefully
- Extracts preliminary and final reads from order history
- Shows "View Image" link when results are available

**Data Displayed:**
- Study Type (e.g., "X-Ray: Upper extremity, arm, right")
- Diagnosis (code and description)
- Clinical History
- Preliminary Read (if available)
- Final Read (if available)  
- Result
- View Image link

### 2. Progress Note Integration
**Location:** `apps/ehr/src/features/css-module/components/progress-note/ProgressNoteDetails.tsx`

**Changes:**
- Imported RadiologyContainer component
- Added RadiologyContainer to sections list between Lab Results and Procedures
- Component handles its own conditional rendering

### 3. Visual Design
The RadiologyContainer follows the same visual pattern as other Progress Note containers:
- Section title in primary blue color (`#0F347C`)
- Study type as a subsection header in blue
- Property labels in bold with values following
- Consistent spacing and typography
- Material-UI themed components

## Testing
A test file template is available at `/tmp/RadiologyContainer.test.tsx` showing:
- Conditional rendering logic
- Loading state handling
- Data display functionality
- Empty state behavior

## Future Enhancements

### PDF Generation
The visit note PDF generation is currently commented out and requires additional work:

**Required Changes:**
1. Modify `AllChartData` type in `packages/zambdas/src/shared/pdf/visit-details-pdf/visit-note-pdf-creation.ts` to include radiology data
2. Update PDF generation callers to fetch radiology data
3. Implement radiology data mapping in `composeDataForPdf` function
4. Uncomment PDF rendering logic in `packages/zambdas/src/shared/pdf/visit-note-pdf.ts`

**Type Structure Ready:**
```typescript
// In VisitNoteData interface
radiology?: {
  studyType: string;
  diagnosis: string;
  clinicalHistory?: string;
  preliminaryRead?: string;
  finalRead?: string;
  result?: string;
}[];
```

### API Integration
The implementation uses the existing radiology API:
- `usePatientRadiologyOrders` hook from `apps/ehr/src/features/radiology/components/usePatientRadiologyOrders.ts`
- `GetRadiologyOrderListZambdaOrder` types from `packages/utils/lib/types/api/radiology/index.ts`
- No changes needed to the radiology API or data fetching logic

## Deployment Considerations
- The RadiologyContainer component is self-contained and handles its own data fetching
- No database migrations required
- No API changes required
- Component gracefully handles missing or empty data
- Loading states prevent UI flickering during data fetch

## Visual Impact
The Progress Note now displays radiology information between Lab Results and Procedures sections, providing healthcare providers with a comprehensive view of all diagnostic information in one location. The information is displayed in a clear, scannable format that matches the existing Progress Note design language.
