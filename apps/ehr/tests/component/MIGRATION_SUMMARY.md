# E2E to Component Test Migration Summary

## Overview

This document tracks the migration of E2E tests to component tests for improved speed and reliability.

## Completed Migrations

### addPatientPage.spec.ts → AddPatientValidation.test.tsx

**Date**: October 30, 2025

**Migrated Tests** (5 E2E tests removed):
1. ✅ Open "Add patient page", click "Cancel", navigates back to visits page
2. ✅ Open "Add patient page", click "Search patient", validation error on "Mobile phone" field shown
3. ✅ Open "Add patient page" then enter invalid phone number, click "Search patient", validation error shown
4. ✅ Add button does nothing when any required field is empty (comprehensive validation test)
5. ✅ Open "Add patient page" then enter invalid date of birth, validation error shown

**Component Tests Created** (9 tests):
1. Cancel button navigates back to visits page
2. Shows validation error on mobile phone field when searching without entering a phone number
3. Shows validation error on mobile phone field when searching with an invalid phone number
4. Shows validation error on date of birth field when entering an invalid date format
5. Shows error when clicking Add button without selecting a location
6. Shows error message when clicking Add button without searching for patient
7. Validates all required fields are present after patient search
8. Shows dialog when clicking Add for prebook visit without selecting a time slot
9. Shows dialog when clicking Add for post-telemed visit without selecting a time slot

**Performance Impact**:
- **Before**: 5 E2E tests × ~12 seconds = ~60 seconds
- **After**: 9 component tests = ~4 seconds total
- **Improvement**: ~93% faster (15x speed improvement)

**Test Coverage**:
- More comprehensive (9 tests vs 5 tests)
- Better isolation (no network/backend dependencies)
- More reliable (no browser timing issues)

## Remaining E2E Tests in addPatientPage.spec.ts

These tests still require E2E because they involve:
- Full appointment creation workflow with backend
- Patient data persistence verification
- Multi-step processes with API calls

1. Add walk-in visit for new patient
2. Add pre-book visit for new patient
3. Add post-telemed visit for new patient (skipped - flaky)
4. Tests for existing patients (currently skipped)

## Guidelines for Future Migrations

**Migrate to Component Tests when**:
- Testing client-side validation only
- Testing UI state changes
- Testing error message display
- Testing navigation (mock router)
- No backend/API integration required

**Keep as E2E Tests when**:
- Creating/modifying data in backend
- Testing full user workflows
- Verifying data persistence
- Testing multi-service integration
- Testing real routing/navigation between pages

## Total Impact

- **Tests migrated**: 5 → 9 (more comprehensive)
- **Time saved per run**: ~56 seconds
- **Reliability improvement**: Component tests don't suffer from E2E flakiness
- **CI/CD impact**: Faster feedback loops, less flaky builds
