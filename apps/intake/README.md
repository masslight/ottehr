Patients use the application to sign up for and manage appointments. They can do things like schedule new appointments, cancel appointments, reschedule appointments, and fill out paperwork for appointments.

## Run Locally

After completing the steps in the monorepo's top level README.md, you can run locally in a number of different configurations depending on what you are trying to do. All of the ways you can run have their own helper script in package.json which you can run like:

```[bash]
npm run start
```
