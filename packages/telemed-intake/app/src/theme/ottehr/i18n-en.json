Our policy is to<br /><br />collect payments via credit card, flexible spending card, cash, or check at the time of service. If you have<br />insurance, our verification system will indicate whether you have an unmet deductible and determine your<br />expected payment.<br /><br />At the time of your visit, you will be asked to review and sign our Card on File form. Afterwards, we keep<br />your payment method on file with our HIPAA-compliant, secure credit card processor in the event there is<br />additional patient responsibility. For your protection, only a portion of your card will be visible in our<br />computer system.<br /><br />Once your insurance company has processed your claims, they will send an Explanation of Benefits (EOB) to both<br />you and our office, showing your total patient responsibility. Upon receipt of the EOB, our billing department<br />will determine if there is a remaining balance based on your insurance companyâ€™s adjustment/payment. If there<br />is an additional balance, you will receive an email with the amount due. We will charge the card on file 5<br />days after this initial email. If you disagree with the patient amount owed, please contact your insurance<br />carrier immediately.<br /><br />If you do not pay in full at the time of service and/or provide a payment method to be placed on file,<br />you/your child may not be seen. Please contact our billing department should you have any questions."
